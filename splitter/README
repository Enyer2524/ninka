Before you can start using Ninka, you need to create the sentence
breaking program "splitter.pl"

We have used as the basis of our code the perl script "splitter.pl"
(and its associated data), from Paul Clough, located at

http://ir.shef.ac.uk/cloughie/software.html

as the basis for our program.

Paul has given us permission to use with code. We are very grateful
for this.
